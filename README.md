This assignment allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of JS and Plotly. By leveraging all of these technologies, I was able to build a web page that displayed visuals describing the data for a particular sample of a dataset.

About the data: The data consisted of a json object which contained metadata about the subject, and data about the microbes found within the belly button of the subject. The data included the OTU ids, the OTU labels, OTU values.

I was able to publish my web pages through Github's server. I was able to create an interactive dashboard using JS, which utilized an event listener that would update the plotly visuals any time a new sample ID was selected in the drop down menu. I was able to dynamically edit the html by leveraging the DOM.
